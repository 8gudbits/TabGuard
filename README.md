## How It Works

TabGuard uses Chrome's `declarativeNetRequest` API to block websites at the network level. This approach:

- Works without requiring permission to read your browsing data
- Is more efficient than content script-based blocking
- Provides immediate blocking without page reloads

### File Structure

- `background.js` - Extension service worker and blocking logic
- `options.js` - Options page functionality
- `options.html` - Options page markup
- `options.css` - Styling for the options page
